# CellTypeGenomics
CellTypeGenomics is an open-source project that utilizes Human Protein Atlas data to identify the cell-type origins of differentially expressed genes.
The object is to create a Python script that contains a function, which takes in a list of genes and outputs a prioritized list of genes that are potentially over-represented, based on Human Protein Atlas.
